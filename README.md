# Gym Logger App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals

This idea from the project came from one of my friends. Everytime we worked out together, he would record everything (the excersizes he did, the amounts he lifted, his weight, etc.) in his notes app in order to track his progress over time. I loved the idea, but found it really difficult to pull out my phone and type everything out after every rep. <br />
<br />
Thus, I had the idea to build an app for it! I wanted to be able to log my workouts with just a few clicks!

## Process

Originally, I had brainstormed a lot of ideas: a WatchOS app that had a google calendar integration that would send push notifications with motivational metrics and...it got out of hand pretty soon. Since I was trying to build this in a couple days, I decided to reel it in a little â€” just get out something that works first.
<br />
<br />
I ended up starting with a web app that stores the logged data in browser cache. This was my first time learning about client-side storage and it was a lot of fun to implement! And now that I'm storing the data, I'll be able to go back later and implement some more cool tools (like progress charts and habit tracking calendars) over it.

## Tools
